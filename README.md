## Overview

The DevSeeker backend is built using Node.js and Express.js to handle incoming HTTP requests and manage the business logic of the application. It provides RESTful APIs for user authentication, job postings, candidate profiles, and other essential functionalities.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up environment variables (e.g., database connection strings, API keys).
4. Run the server using `npm start`.

## Usage

After installation, the server will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or a different port if configured).

Use tools like Postman or cURL to interact with the API endpoints.
